      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <!-- 200 word summary of the workshop purpose -->
      <!-- CONTEXT: Why the need is so pressing or important     -->
      The Semantic Web is increasingly becoming a centralized story:
      we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
      to perform intense reasoning, data mining, and query execution.
      This kind of centralization leads to a number of problems,
      including lock-in effects, lack of users' control of their data,
      limited incentives for interoperability and openness, and the
      resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation.
      <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
      Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
      to bring back the “Web” to the Semantic Web,
      aiming for intelligent clients—instead of intelligent servers—as
      sketched in the original Semantic Web vision.
      <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
      Following the success of last year’s workshop at ISWC2018,
      DeSemWeb2019 focuses on decentralized and client-side applications,
      to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
      While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
      we see an urgent need to revalue the role of clients.
      <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
      This proposal details the topics of the workshop,
      as well as the organisational aspects.
      <!-- FINDINGS: What the work done yielded or revealed      -->
      We believe this proposal will help
      put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
      <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
      which should lead to new inspiration and initiatives
      <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
      to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

    <section id="continuation">
      <h2>Continuation</h2>
      <!-- Why is it worthwhile to continue the workshop in 2019?
           Discussion may include novel topics that are emerging,
           external developments that prompt new challenges, etc.
           Workshops should also argue why they continue to be relevant
           and maintain a focused identity versus the main conference.
           (No longer than half a page) -->
       <p>
         The <a href="http://iswc2017.desemweb.org/">2017 edition</a> of the workshop
         proved there is a strong interest in decentralization.
         We were able to organize a <a href="http://iswc2017.desemweb.org/program/">full-day program</a>
         and reached a peek attendance of 70 people,
         with contributions from academia as well as industry.
         Nonetheless, decentralization remains a relatively new topic at ISWC,
         so a focused workshop is the best venue
         to gather people with similar interests.
         The topic has also gained significant media attention in the past couple of months,
         and will likely continue to be an object of discussion in the years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
         Despite this widespread attention,
         many important challenges still remain unsolved.
         In particular, new decentralized applications need to emerge,
         which is why we will organize a focused track specifically on applications.
         At the same time, underlying technologies need to be refined and analyzed,
         including (but not limited to) security, querying, reasoning,
         trust, visualization, and privacy.
         On the infrastructural level,
         we need to think about the relationship between decentralization and replication,
         and find the right role for Linked Data Notifications in this.

      <h2>Past editions</h2>
      <!-- Describe the development of the workshop series over the past 3-5 years.
           Provide quantitative information on submissions and attendance.
           (No longer than a page) -->
       <p>
         <a href="http://iswc2017.desemweb.org/">The workshop at ISWC2017</a>
         attracted <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2017/DeSemWeb">14 submissions</a>,
         13 of which were incorporated into the program.
         The workshop had a peak attendance of around 70 people
         from both academia and industry,
         and an average attendance of 30-40 during the day.
         Given these high numbers for a first edition,
         we expect the second workshop to be similarly popular.

      <h2>Length</h2>
      <!-- Half-day or full-day -->
      <p>
        Like last year, we propose a <strong>full-day workshop</strong>.

    <section id="format">
      <h2>Format</h2>
      <!-- The intended mix of events, such as paper presentations,
           invited talks, panels, demos and general discussion
           (Either a tabular schedule or a one paragraph summary) -->
      <p>
        The morning will start with a thought-provoking <strong>keynote</strong>
        on the current state of the (Semantic) Web,
        and why decentralization is crucial for the future.
        After discussion with the speaker,
        we continue with <strong>talks</strong> by members of the community.
        These can be lightning talks, article presentations,
        demonstrations, and other forms of contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the afternoon, depending on the number of submissions,
        we might first have another slot of talks,
        where we will emphasize <strong>industry-focused contributions</strong>.
        We will end the day with a special session on <strong>applications</strong>,
        where participants are challenged to build on top
        of the <a href="http://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> platform.
